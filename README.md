# MRNet
## Deep learning-based CSI feedback via multiple receiving antennas.

MRNet-1R.py compresses, reports and reconstructs CSI of each receiving antenna separately.

MRNet-4R.py compresses, reports and reconstructs CSI of multiple receiving antenna cooperatively.

The cooperation technique can be applied to other existing (or future) DL-based CSI feedback networks to make them have the same ability to process cooperative CSI feedback of multiple receiving antennas.
